# Security Review and Audit

**Description**: Perform comprehensive security review of MailSentinel codebase, configurations, and deployment practices.

## Steps

1. **Code Security Analysis**
   - Run static analysis tools (gosec, semgrep) on entire codebase
   - Review input validation for email content and YAML profiles
   - Check for hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data
   - Verify proper error handling without information leakage

2. **Dependency Security**
   - Audit Go module dependencies for known vulnerabilities
   - Check for outdated packages with security patches
   - Verify dependency integrity and supply chain security
   - Review third-party library usage and permissions

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Review OAuth implementation and token storage security
   - Verify Gmail API scope minimization and proper usage
   - Check token encryption (AES-256-GCM) and key management
   - Test token refresh and expiration handling

4. **Data Protection Review**
   - Verify email content sanitization before Ollama processing
   - Check audit log integrity with SHA-256 checksums
   - Review file permissions (0600 for secrets, 0644 for configs)
   - Validate secure memory handling and cleanup

5. **Network Security**
   - Confirm localhost-only Ollama communication (127.0.0.1:11434)
   - Verify TLS 1.3 usage for Gmail API connections
   - Check firewall rules and network access restrictions
   - Test for any unintended external network calls

6. **Security Documentation**
   - Update threat model with new attack vectors
   - Document security controls and mitigation strategies
   - Create incident response procedures
   - Generate security compliance report
